# depreciative-return makes killing the same kind of mob over and over again worth less with each
#   kill. With the first kill of a kind of mob, their reward amount is the full amount. Each
#   time after that, they lose the percentage field's percentage of money from the kill. This stacks,
#   and could eventually lead to earning no money from killing the same mobs over and over.
